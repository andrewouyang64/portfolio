                        <span style="color: coral">After</span> I graduated with a bachelor degree in automation many years ago, I was a computer
                        hardware engineer, a business director and a business consultant in different stages in my careers. I have extensive experiences
                        in computer technology, business management and IT implementation for business.
                        Recently I have completed most of a coding course in full stack web development at University of Sydney. Over the course I 
                        learnt and practiced programming with languages and libraraies/frameworks that include
                        <span style="color: aqua;"> HTML, CSS, Boostrap, Javascript, jQuery, API, node.js, express.js, MYSQL database, 
                        sequelize, RESTful crud, MVC structure, jest test and insomnia. I also gained experiences on project management when using
                        Agile and Kanban methods and HEROKU deploymentation for group projects.</span>
                        I'm passionate about adapting to new technoloies which I intend to use to solve complex real world problems. Currently I continue
                        studying full stack web delevopment as well as cloud computing and AI/ML as I intend to become a software engeering consultant.

                <p>
                    This is an imformative tool for tourists to quickly obtain location and backgroud info
                    for a city they may visit. It utilizes the Google map and Wikipedia by implementing
                    API querying. It has a fully functional Google map and is completely interactive while the major info
                    is extracted out from Wikipedia. <br> <br>The application provides
                    user-friendly UI. It records up to four previous searches.To re-visit a search just by clicking
                    on the name on the list bar. New search is added at the top with the first
                    letter automatically converted to uppercase. A clear botton gives an option to
                    clear out previous searches. By default, the city of Sydney is displayed. When an invalid name
                    is entered, an error message will popup. <br> <br>HTML, CSS, CSS framework from Tailwind, Javascript, 
                    jQuery and server side API data fetching are used in this application. I was responsible for 
                    Javascript structuring and rendering, as well as some CSS stylings. Github

                <p>
                   This app was coded largely on Javascript logic programming, some CSS styling as well as HTML. This
                   password generator can generate a password for a user with choices of uppercase, numeric or symbol between 8 to
                   128 charaters. User can choose different combination by ticking on the checkbox and length of the password.
                   After ticking the options, by clicking on the Generator button, a randomized password is generated and displayed. Github

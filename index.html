                        <span style="color: coral">After</span> I graduated with a bachelor degree in automation many years ago, I was a computer
                        hardware engineer, a business director and a business consultant in different stages in my careers. I have extensive experiences
                        in computer technology, business management and IT implementation for business.
                        Recently I just completed a coding course on full stack web development. Over the course I learnt and practiced programming with languages and libraraies/frameworks that include
                        <span style="color: aqua;"> HTML, CSS, Boostrap, Javascript, jQuery, API, node.js, express.js, MYSQL database, sequelize, RESTful crud, MVC structure, jest test and insomnia.
                        I also gained experiences on project management when using Agile and Kanban methods and HEROKU deploymentation for group project develepment.</span>
                        I'm passionate about adapting to new technoloies which I intend to use to solve complex real world problems. Currently I'm continuing
                        study of full stack web delevopment as I intend to become a software engineer.

                <p>
                    This is an imformative tool for tourists to quickly obtain location and backgroud info
                    for a city. It utilizes the Google map and Wikipedia by implementing
                    API querying. It has a fully functional Google map with completely interactive while the major info
                    is extracted out from Wikipedia. <br> <br>The application provides
                    user-friendly UI. It records up to four previous searches.To re-visit a search just by clicking
                    on the name on the list bar. New search will be added at the top with the first
                    letter automatically converted to uppercase. A clear botton gives an option to
                    clear out previous searches. By default, the city of Sydney is displayed. When an invalid name
                    is entered, an error message will popup. <br> <br>HTML, CSS, CSS framework from Tailwind, Javascript, 
                    jQuery and server side API data fetching are used in this design. I was responsible for 
                    Javascript structuring and rendering, as well as some CSS stylings. Github

                   This assignment was aiming to practicing largely on Javascript programming, some CSS styling as well as HTML. this
                   password generator can generate a password for a user with choices of uppercase, numeric or symbol between 8 to
                   128 charaters. User can choose different combination by ticking on the checkbox and length of the password.
                   When user clicking on the Generator button, a randomized password is generated and displayed. Github

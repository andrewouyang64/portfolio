                        <span style="color: coral">After</span> I graduated with a bachelor degree in automation many years ago, I used to be a computer
                        hardware engineer, a business director and a business consultant in different stages. I have extensive experiences
                        in computer technology, business management and IT implementation for business.
                        Recently I just completed a coding course on front-end web development. Over the course I learnt and practiced programming languages and tools such as
                        <span style="color: aqua;"> HTML, CSS, Boostrap, Javascript, jQuery, API data fetching, 
                         Git, Github</span> and collabolating with others. 
                        I also gained experiences on project management when using <span style="color: aqua;">Agile and Kanban methods </span>. 
                        I'm passionate about adapting to new technoloies which I intend to use to solve complex real world problems. Currently I'm continuing
                        study of back-end web delevopment as I intend to become a software engineer.

                <p>
                    This is an imformative tool for tourists to quickly obtain location and backgroud info
                    for a city. It utilizes the Google map and Wikipedia by implementing
                    API querying. It has a fully functional Google map with completely interactive while the major info
                    is extracted out from Wikipedia. <br> <br>The application provides
                    user-friendly UI. It records up to four previous searches.To re-visit a search just by clicking
                    on the name on the list bar. New search will be added at the top with the first
                    letter automatically converted to uppercase. A clear botton gives an option to
                    clear out previous searches. By default, the city of Sydney is displayed. When an invalid name
                    is entered, an error message will popup. <br> <br>HTML, CSS, CSS framework from Tailwind, Javascript, 
                    jQuery and server side API data fetching are used in this design. I was responsible for 
                    Javascript structuring and rendering, as well as some CSS stylings. Github

                <p>
                    This assignment aimed at practicing third party server side API data fetching and dynamically creating
                    HTML elements in Javascript. The application provides a useful tool to obtain weather info for
                    up to 6 days for a city you search. Each has an icon that represents the weather condition. The Current
                    weather section displays a level of severity of UV by different colours. Previrus searches are saved. Github

                <p>
                   This assignment was aiming to practicing largely on Javascript programming, some CSS styling as well as HTML. this
                   password generator can generate a password for a user with choices of uppercase, numeric or symbol between 8 to
                   128 charaters. User can choose different combination by ticking on the checkbox and length of the password.
                   When user clicking on the Generator button, a randomized password is generated and displayed. Github
